Autoimport missing python libraries.

Throughout the development of a python program you continuously need to manage
the python import statements either because you need one new object or because
you no longer need it. This means that you need to stop writing whatever you
were writing, go to the top of the file, create or remove the import statement
and then resume coding.

This workflow break is annoying and almost always unnecessary. `autoimport`
solves this problem if you execute it whenever you have an import error, for
example by configuring your editor to run it when saving the file.
